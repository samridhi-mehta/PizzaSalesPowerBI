**Problem Statement**

A Pizzeria needs a data-driven approach to analyze sales performance, identify customer preferences, and optimize operations. The goal is to:

1. Understand overall sales trends and revenue distribution.

2. Identify best and worst-selling pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders.

3. Analyze customer ordering behavior, including peak times and preferred pizza sizes.

4. Improve menu offerings based on data insights.

5. Support strategic decision-making for marketing and inventory management.

**Approach & KPI Selection**

To address these objectives, we designed a **Power BI dashboard** using the following methodology:

Conducted an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on pizza sales data.

Identified key areas that impact business revenue and customer satisfaction.

**2. Selecting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

**Sales Performance Metrics**

    Total Revenue – Measures overall business earnings.

    Total Orders & Total Pizzas Sold – Helps track demand.

    Average Order Value (AOV) – Assesses customer spending behavior.

    Average Pizzas Per Order – Identifies typical order sizes.

**Trend Analysis**

    Daily & Monthly Order Trends – Pinpoints peak sales periods.

    Product Performance

    Sales by Pizza Category & Size – Identifies popular offerings.

    Best & Worst-Selling Pizzas – Guides menu optimization.

**Customer Preferences**
